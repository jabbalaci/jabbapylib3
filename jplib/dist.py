    The Levenshtein distance (or edit distance) between two strings
    is the minimal number of "edit operations" required to change
    one string into the other. The two strings can have different

    insertion, or alteration of a character in either string.

    Example: the Levenshtein distance of "ag-tcc" and "cgctca" is 3.
